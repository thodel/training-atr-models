"""Resolving a :class:`DatasetSpec` to HuggingFace ``data_files`` — no ``datasets``.

``dh-unibe/image-text_medieval-scripts_xiv-xv-xvi`` is ~6.6 TB spread over 694
per-project parquet directories::

    data/<split>/<project_name>/<timestamp>-<shard>.parquet

asterAIx has ~356 GB free, so a job that calls ``load_dataset(repo)`` without
``data_files`` is not slow — it is a filled disk. Every selection therefore goes
through :func:`data_files_for`, which refuses an empty selection outright.

The row helpers below know the column layout (``image`` is an
``Image(decode=False)`` column, i.e. raw JPEG bytes pass straight through) but
import nothing from ``datasets``: the trainer service hands us plain dicts.

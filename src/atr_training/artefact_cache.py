"""Reusing a compiled corpus across jobs (#109).

`prepare` and `compile` write into ``jobs/<job-id>/``, so every submission starts
from the hub — even when the selection is byte-for-byte the one compiled ten
minutes earlier. Between 24 August and 5 September the same four-dataset German
corpus was compiled **eight times**: 12,300 pages, 325,700 lines, ~41 GB of arrow,
about 2.5 hours each. Five of those runs differ from their predecessor only in a
hyperparameter the *train* stage reads.

The pair on 5 September is the plainest case: two jobs twelve minutes apart, the
same 12,301 pages and 325,768 lines, the second rebuilding all 41 GB before
failing in exactly the same place as the first.

What this module owns is the **key** — the question "would compiling this spec
again produce what is already on disk?" — and a store addressed by it. What it
deliberately does not own is compiling; the backends keep that, because only they
know what compiling means.

Two decisions are load-bearing:

**The key is the spec, never the job id.** A job id is unique by construction, so
keying on it would cache nothing. The key covers every input that changes the
artefact — the repo and its revision, the projects, the split, granularity,
partition and seed (which decide *which* pages land on each side), any page cap,
and the engine, since two backends turn the same pages into different things.

**An unpinned revision expires.** ``revision: null`` means "whatever the dataset
is today", and a cache that ignores that would serve last month's pages while
reporting a fresh compile — worse than the waste it replaces. Entries built from
an unpinned spec are reusable only within :data:`UNPINNED_MAX_AGE_DAYS`; a spec
that names a revision is reusable indefinitely, because it cannot have moved.

**But the deadline is for new runs, not for a run already under way.** A job that
adopted an entry **claims** it, and from then on that one job may keep reusing it
however old it has become, while every other job still faces the deadline. The
case is the two-stage UBELIX flow: stage 1 adopts an entry in eight seconds,
stage 2 waits days in the Slurm queue and resolves the same key again in a fresh
process — and a job that adopted has nothing in its own directory to fall back
on. Job 16191742 was submitted with five days left on its corpus and an estimated
start that slipped a day at a time (#96). The caution behind the deadline is about
choosing data that may have moved; this job chose already.

        These are ~40 GB each, so an unbounded cache trades one way of filling the
        share for another. Three rules the size budget does not get to override:

        An entry used within ``min_idle_hours`` is never removed. A kraken run
        reads its arrow for its whole length, so "nothing has opened it in three
        days" is the cheap evidence that no run depends on it.

        **A claimed entry is never removed, expired or not** (#96). A claim is a
        job saying it is training against this corpus, and a job waiting days in a
        Slurm queue opens nothing in the meantime — idle time cannot see it, which
        is what made the deletion of a corpus a queued job still needed possible.
        Claims older than :data:`CLAIM_MAX_AGE_DAYS` do not hold, so a job that
        died without releasing cannot pin 40 GB for ever.

        And what was removed is returned, with a sentence on where it stopped,
        because a cache that quietly deletes 40 GB is its own kind of problem.

"""Resolving ``TrainRequest.base_model`` — and refusing a bad one at submit (#76).

`docs/TRAINING_PLAN.md` §4 promised that ``base_model`` accepts "a registry id or a
Zenodo DOI". It accepted only a DOI: the kraken runner handed the string straight to
``htrmopo.get_model``, so a perfectly reasonable request died in the **train** stage,
after prepare and compile had already run —

    ValueError in train: kraken-medieval_generic_b is not a valid DOI

`kraken-medieval_generic_b` is in ``config/models.yaml``. The user had every reason to
expect it to work, and lost a run finding out otherwise.

Two things are fixed here, and the second matters more than the first:

1. **A registry id resolves** to the `zenodo_id` (or `local_path`) of its entry, which
   is what §4 described all along.
2. **The check happens at submit.** Everything needed to reject a bad reference is
   available the moment the request arrives; nothing about it improves by waiting for a
   ten-hour prepare to finish first. Same argument as the dataset verification (#46) and
   the step-count guard (#72) — the difference between a guard and a post-mortem is
   where it runs.

The base is engine-specific and the namespaces do not overlap: kraken bases are kraken
weights (Zenodo, or a file on disk), while `vllm` and `trocr` bases are HuggingFace repo
ids. Validating one against the other's rules would reject correct requests, so each
engine gets its own.

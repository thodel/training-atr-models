"""Per-epoch metrics — ``training.json`` (#38), built the only way that works (#51).

A finished job reports exactly one number. ``kraken-medieval-scripts-v1`` ended at
CER 0.7074 with ``best_0.2925.mlmodel``, and from the record alone there is no way
to tell whether it plateaued at 29 % accuracy by epoch five or was still climbing
at epoch fifty — which call for opposite responses (change the data, or train
longer).

**Why not the log.** The obvious source is ``train.log``, and it cannot work.
ketos renders progress through ``rich``; into a redirected stdout the layout
survives and the numbers do not, so every ``val_accuracy:`` line in a completed
run's log arrives bare (#51). There is no terminal width at which a progress-bar
renderer becomes a metrics log.

**What is used instead.** Lightning's ``ModelCheckpoint`` writes the metric into
the *filename* — ``checkpoint_<NN>-<val_metric>.ckpt`` — so the checkpoint
directory is a record the trainer itself produced, needing no cooperation and no
parsing of decorated text.

**What that costs, stated plainly.** kraken keeps the **top 10** checkpoints, so
this is not every epoch: it is the ten best, and the file names say which epochs
they were. That is still the question worth answering. If the surviving
checkpoints are epochs 41–50, the run was still improving when it stopped; if
they are 3–12, it peaked early and got worse for forty epochs. Reading a curve as
if it were complete would be the mistake, so ``training.json`` records
``complete: false`` and the reason.

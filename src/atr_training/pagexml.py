"""PageXML handling for the prepare stage — stdlib only.

The HF rows carry the *original* Transkribus PageXML, whose ``@imageFilename``
points at a file that does not exist on our disk. kraken resolves that attribute
relative to the XML file's own directory, so materializing a page means writing
``<stem>.jpg`` + ``<stem>.xml`` side by side and rewriting the attribute to the
JPEG's basename.

The rewrite is a **targeted edit of the ``<Page>`` start tag**, not an
ElementTree round-trip: re-serializing would rewrite namespace prefixes to
``ns0:`` and drop the XML declaration, and kraken's own parser has opinions about
both. Reading, where nothing is written back, uses ElementTree with local-name
matching so it works for any PAGE schema version.

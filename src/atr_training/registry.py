"""TEMPORARY — the gateway's registry schema, copied here in #3.

Only the WRITING side still uses this: the three runners' register stage and
`overlay.py` build a `ModelSpec` to record a trained model. #14 replaces that
with one file per model on the share, and this module goes with it.

The READING side no longer does. Resolving a base model reads the file the
gateway publishes to the share, through `atr_training.shared_registry`, which
needs four fields instead of all of these. A test pins that nothing new starts
depending on this copy.

Original docstring follows.

Model registry — loads ``config/models.yaml`` into typed ``ModelSpec`` objects.

The registry is the single source of truth the gateway exposes via ``/models``.
Clients (e.g. agentic_historian/model_selector.py) score script/lang/century
against this metadata to choose a model, then call ``/recognize`` with its id.

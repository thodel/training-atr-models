"""Materialized pages → VLM training samples. Pure: stdlib + the contracts.

The VLM backend's ``compile`` stage is the analogue of ``ketos compile``. Where
kraken turns ``pages/*.{jpg,xml}`` into an ``.arrow`` dataset of normalized line
crops, this turns the same pages into a **JSONL of samples**, one object per
line:

.. code-block:: json

    {"image": "pages/000012_x.jpg", "text": "Item ontfaen van Janne",
     "source_type": "line", "bbox": [10, 24, 812, 96], "page": "000012_x.xml"}

Everything here is decisions — which lines become samples, what text they carry,
which crop rectangle — and none of it is pixels. The cropping itself needs PIL
and lives in the engine (``vlm_train_svc.runner``), so this module is importable
and unit-testable in the repo venv, the same rule the rest of
:mod:`atr_training` follows.

``source_type`` travels with each sample because the collator budgets visual
tokens by it (:data:`~atr_training.contracts.VLM_PIXEL_BUDGET`) — the
same field, spelled the same way, as in ``lassberg/vlm_training``.

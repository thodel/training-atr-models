"""The prepare stage: HuggingFace rows → kraken-readable pages on disk.

``datasets`` is imported **inside** :class:`HFPageSource` so this module (and the
runner that drives it) stays importable in the repo venv, where the test suite
runs. The source is injectable, so the pipeline is exercised with in-memory rows
and no network.

Each kept row becomes two sibling files::

    pages/000123_023499_0012_623887.jpg     the original JPEG, byte-for-byte
    pages/000123_023499_0012_623887.xml     its PageXML, @imageFilename rewritten

Byte-for-byte matters: the column is ``Image(decode=False)``, so re-encoding
would degrade every training line for no reason.

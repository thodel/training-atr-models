"""What the GPUs on *this* machine are doing, and who is doing it.

**A deliberate duplicate** of ``serving-atr-inference/src/atr_serving/gpu.py``
(serving#137, T2.7). The gateway still needs its copy for its own vLLM budget;
this one exists because after the split the gateway's ``/train/gpu`` could only
read idhefix's cards and match asteraix's job pids against idhefix's ``/proc`` —
where a pid collision marks a local stranger as ``registered`` to a foreign job
and drops it from ``unaccounted_mib``, silently (#13). A pid means something
only on the host that issued it, so the reading has to happen here. Importing
the gateway's module is not an option either: this repo never imports the
serving half (tests/test_isolation.py).

``inspect`` and its helpers are the gateway's, unchanged, so the two files diff
cleanly. Not copied: ``card_memory``, the gateway's launch-sizing helper — the
trainer sizes a start with :func:`atr_training.preflight.check_vram`. Added:
:func:`card_rows`, the totals the gateway's route computed inline.

The gateway's own account of why this module exists:

The scheduler's view and the machine's state drift apart, and nothing surfaces
the gap. Three incidents in two weeks, each found by hand and late:

- a PyTorch data-loader worker outlived its training process, kept
  ``/dev/nvidia1`` mapped and so kept a dead parent's CUDA context alive. It held
  27 530 MiB under the process name ``[Not Found]`` — a pid with no ``/proc``
  entry — for sixteen hours while both cards reported 0 % utilisation and a
  queued job waited for memory nobody was using.
- a three-day run was "cancelled on request" by nobody in that session.
- a 30-hour ``ketos`` run appeared on a card belonging to no job at all.

This module answers, for every process holding GPU memory: who owns it, how old
it is, what it is running, and — the part that matters — whether it belongs to a
job the trainer knows about.

`nvidia-smi` is shelled out to rather than binding NVML: the service stays free
of ML dependencies (pyproject.toml), and the two queries used here are stable CSV.

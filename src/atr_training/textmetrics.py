"""CER / WER — one implementation, used by the eval harness and the VLM trainer.

``ketos test`` reports **corpus-level** rates: total edits over total reference
characters, not the mean of per-line rates. The two differ, and not by a little —
averaging per-line rates lets a three-character line weigh as much as a
sixty-character one. :func:`score_pairs` therefore aggregates counts and divides
once, so a VLM job's CER is the same *kind* of number as a kraken job's and the
two can be compared in ``eval/run_eval.py``.

Stdlib only, like the rest of :mod:`atr_training`.

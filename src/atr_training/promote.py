"""The promotion gate (#36): advertise a trained model only once it has served.

Registering a model writes a row in a YAML file. That is not evidence of
anything — and confidently advertising models the host could not run is this
repo's most repeated failure (#21, #30, #31, #32). So a trained model is
registered ``enabled: false``, and only a **real transcription through the real
engine** flips it: the trainer posts one held-out page to the gateway's ``/ocr``
with the new model id, and non-empty text is the gate.

Three properties worth stating, because each is a decision:

* **The page comes from the run's own validation split.** Any page would prove
  the engine can load the weights, but a held-out page also exercises the
  material the model was scored on, and it is already on disk.
* **A failed gate does not fail the job.** The model trained, it scored, it is
  registered — it simply is not servable yet, which is a fact about the serving
  side. `docs/TRAINING_PLAN.md` §5 originally said a job completes only with a
  passing smoke recognition; that reads well until the VLM backend, whose
  adapters *cannot* be served until ``scripts/merge_loras.py`` bakes them in.
  Failing those jobs would call a good training run a failure. The job completes,
  ``promoted`` is false, the reason is on the record, and ``/models`` stays quiet.
* **Empty text is a failure, not a pass.** A 200 with ``""`` is exactly what #21
  was about: the gateway used to answer that way for a model it could not run.

The HTTP call is injectable, so the whole gate is testable without a gateway.

"""Ask the gateway to give the card back before a run gets on it (#129).

A training job spends its first hour or two in ``prepare`` and ``compile``,
which are disk, network and CPU. The card is idle throughout — v5 sat at 0 %
utilisation for 74 minutes — and for that whole time the gateway may serve
recognition requests, including ones that have to load a model first.

What it must not do is still be holding that model when the run reaches
``train``. That is how v4 died: a vLLM instance launched at 08:53 during
prepare was still resident at 09:52 when training began, and the run hit
OutOfMemoryError three minutes later.

The first answer was to refuse every launch from the moment a job started,
which is safe and costs an hour of inference on an empty GPU per run. This is
the second: the gateway keeps serving through the CPU stages, and the trainer
asks it to let go at the boundary. A failure to reach the gateway is reported
and not fatal — the trainer's own VRAM preflight still stands behind it, and it
is the one that actually refuses to start.

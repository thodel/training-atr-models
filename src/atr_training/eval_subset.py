"""Which held-out pages the test stage actually scores (#120).

The test stage never had enough time to generate a transcription for every
validation page, so it takes ``eval_samples`` of them — and until this module it
took the **first** ones. A multi-dataset job writes ``val.jsonl`` one dataset
after another (``_prepare_multi`` extends one list per spec), so the head of that
file is the head of the first dataset. For
``20260910T110352Z-qwen3vl-german-pages-v3`` that meant 196 of the first 200
validation pages came from the Zurich Rats- und Richtebücher: its reported CER of
0.9756 describes one source out of five, and none of the Königsfelden pages that
carry most of the corpus's notation.

Two rules follow, and they are separate:

* **Never the head.** Even a single-dataset job is written in pool order, which
  is materialisation order, which is not random. A seeded sample costs nothing
  and is reproducible from the seed in the report.
* **Every source, when the sources are known.** A corpus-proportional draw would
  still let the largest source decide the headline number; a stratified one
  reports a model that has to read all five. The per-source counts go into the
  report, so a reader can see which mix produced the CER instead of assuming one.

**Attributing a page to its source** is the awkward part, because the pool index
at the front of a page name is not unique across datasets: each dataset starts at
the number of pages *written* so far, while pages that were **skipped** still
consumed indices, so a dataset's range begins inside its predecessor's. The
Transkribus ``docId`` is reliable — one document never spans two datasets — so
each document is placed by whichever of its pages fall in a range no other
dataset can reach, and a document with no such page is left out rather than
guessed. Guessing would put a page under the wrong source name in a per-source
table, which is worse than a table that says it covers fewer pages.

    pages_skipped`` wide and the next one starts where it ends. Exact and without
    overlap.

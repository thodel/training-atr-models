"""CHURRO's ``HistoricalDocument`` XML: reading it back as text, and writing it.

`stanford-oval/churro-3B` is not prompted for plain text. Its own template
(`churro_ocr/templates/presets.py`) is a fixed system message and no user text,
and what it emits is a ``HistoricalDocument``: metadata, then pages divided into
``Header``/``Body``/``Footer`` with ``<Line>`` elements and inline editorial
markup. Scored against our plain-text ground truth as it stands, every tag would
count as an error. See docs/CHURRO_PLAN.md §1.1.

Three things live here:

:func:`flatten` turns the XML into text **by CHURRO's own rule**, copied from
``tooling/evaluation/xml_utils.py`` (github.com/stanford-oval/Churro, Apache-2.0 —
the *code* is Apache; only the model weights are under the Qwen Research
License) so that our numbers stay comparable with the paper's; the test suite
runs the original function beside ours as an oracle. That rule has one property
worth refusing to inherit silently: on an XML parse error it returns an empty
string. Generation that stops at
``max_new_tokens`` leaves unclosed tags, so a *truncated* page would score as if
the model had read nothing — the same trap as #92, one layer down. So a parse
failure falls back to a tolerant reading and **says so** (``parsed=False``), and
the evaluation counts those separately instead of folding them into the CER.

:func:`build_historical_document` is the inverse, for training (plan §3,
Phase 1.1): our ``line_texts`` in CHURRO's schema, so a fine-tune stays on the
model's prior instead of re-teaching it an output format. Metadata is kept to
language and writing direction on purpose — CHURRO was trained to write a
free-text ``PhysicalDescription``, text that is not on the page, and we do not
want to reinforce that.

:func:`normalize_convention` is a *diagnostic*. Our ground truth carries a
notation CHURRO has never seen (``✳``, ``ˀ``, ``₎`` … mostly from the Königsfelden
corpus, plan §2), so a zero-shot CER measures notation before it measures
reading. Applying the same mapping to both sides separates the two. It is never
the headline number, and it never touches training data — the decision of
11.09.2026 is to keep every character.

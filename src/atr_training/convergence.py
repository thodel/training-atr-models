"""The step-count guard (#72): refuse a run that cannot converge.

`kraken-thun-missiven-v1` was submitted with the documented defaults, ran to
completion, and reported **CER 0.9838** — honestly. The arithmetic that explains
it was available the moment ``prepare`` finished:

    2,087 transcribed lines, 189 of them the held-out eval projects → **1,898
    training lines**. At batch 256 that is 8 batches per epoch (7 full + 1
    partial), so **400 optimizer steps** over 50 epochs.

400 optimizer steps for a 15.2 M-parameter network starting from random weights.
(The run was configured ``1cycle``, and at the time this read "ramping and
annealing the learning rate across all of them" — it did neither: kraken sizes
the cycle in samples, so the rate sat frozen near ``lrate/25`` (#96). The step
count is what this guard is about and is unaffected.) An
unconverged CTC network has not learned blank-dominance and emits a character at
nearly every timestep — which *is* an insertion-dominated CER, and which then
cost two days to diagnose (11,191 insertions against 2 deletions).

Every other guard in this subsystem protects a resource: the disk, the GPU, the
filesystem, the honesty of the report. This one protects the **experiment**.

**Why it refuses rather than warns.** A warning in a log nobody reads is what the
previous state already amounted to — the run completed and reported its number.
A configuration that cannot learn should not hold the GPU for three hours, so it
is refused where a full disk is refused.

**Why the floors differ per engine.** A QLoRA fine-tune of an 8 B VLM improved CER
from 1.837 to 0.466 in **38 steps**; a from-scratch CTC network needs thousands.
One number cannot serve both, and the case that actually failed — training from
scratch — gets its own, much higher floor.

The floors are judgement calls, not measurements, and are written here rather
than buried so that raising one is a visible decision.

"""Documents reserved for evaluation, kept out of every training selection (#98).

An eval set drawn from the same corpora a model trains on only stays an eval set
if something enforces it. Nothing did: 198 of the 200 test documents of
``german-medieval-v1`` were in the training set of
``20260910T110352Z-qwen3vl-german-pages-v3``, and 146 of its 150 validation
documents. A CER measured there would have described hands the model had trained
on — which is worse than having no number, because it looks like progress.

**Documents, not pages.** Pages of one manuscript share a hand, ink and layout,
so holding out pages leaks the hand. The unit is the Transkribus ``docId``, the
same unit :mod:`scripts.make_split` groups by, read out of the materialised page
name ``<pool index>_<docId>_<folio>_<image>.xml``.

**Dropping, not refusing.** The reserved documents live inside the corpora a run
is supposed to train on, so refusing the run would make the eval set unusable for
exactly the training it exists to measure. The pages are removed from the
training manifest and the count is recorded on the job, which is the honest
version of what a selection by project name would have done in advance.

The registry is ``config/heldout_eval_documents.json``, in the repo rather than
on the share: it has to be readable when the share is not, it is small, and a
change to it is a change somebody should have to review.

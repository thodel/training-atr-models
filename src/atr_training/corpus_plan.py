"""Choosing and combining HuggingFace datasets into one training corpus (#87).

Selecting a corpus by hand does not scale past a handful of repos, and the two
mistakes it makes are both invisible until a run has already spent its time:

* **Double-counting.** ``koenigsfelden-charters-post-1500`` and
  ``koenigsfelden-adhr-colmar`` publish the same ``FRAD068_03G_SAINT_PIERRE_…``
  project directories, and ``hgb-kf_mixture`` republishes the ``u-17_*`` and
  ``HGB_FT_M4_*`` projects that ``medieval-scripts_xiv-xv-xvi`` already carries.
  Combining the repos naively trains twice on the same pages and reports a
  corpus larger than it is.
* **Domination.** A corpus that is 70 % one archive's hand is a model of that
  hand. Nothing in a page count says so.

So the plan is scored, deduplicated and balanced here, where it can be tested,
and the fetching lives in ``scripts/plan_corpus.py``.

The scoring reflects what the Thun chain actually measured (README, "the first
three runs were under-configured"; TRAINING_PLAN §9c): **script class beats
century.** A Kurrent base a century too late beat a Textura base of the right
period by 40 % relative. So document type — which is the best proxy for script
class in these cards — is weighted at least as heavily as period, and a literary
book hand is penalised for a charter corpus even when its dates fit.

Every figure a plan reports is an *estimate* from dataset-card metadata. Page
counts per project are the dataset's pages divided by its project count, because
the cards do not break it down; lines per page come from a measured ratio. The
only way to learn the real numbers is to run ``prepare``, and a plan says so.

    Evaluation material must come from a repo the plan actually selected. An
    eval-only entry is not a valid spec — ``hf_source`` refuses a ``DatasetSpec``
    with no ``train_projects``, on the grounds that an empty selection must never
    silently mean "everything" — so emitting one would produce a request that dies
    at submit. Refusing here says why, while the plan can still be changed.

    Held-out projects must already be absent from training: pass them to
    ``plan_corpus(exclude_projects=…)`` as well. Training on the evaluation set is
    the one error no later metric can reveal.

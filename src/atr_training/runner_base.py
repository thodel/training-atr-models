"""What every training backend's runner does the same way.

A runner is a **detached** child of the training service (``start_new_session``),
so a ``systemctl --user restart atr-train`` does not kill a three-hour run.
Everything it knows is written to the job directory as it goes; the service reads
that back.

The five stages, the order they run in, how a stage is recorded, and the rule
that *every* failure lands on the job record are identical for kraken and for the
VLM backend — so they live here, and a backend supplies only the four stage
bodies that differ. ``prepare`` is shared outright: both backends want the same
pages materialized from the same HuggingFace slice, split the same seeded,
page-level way.

Heavy imports (``datasets``, torch, kraken) are deliberately kept out of module
scope in this package and its subclasses — they live behind
:class:`~atr_training.prepare.PageSource` and behind the subprocesses the
stages spawn — so a pipeline is importable and testable in the repo venv with
fakes, without a GPU or a network.

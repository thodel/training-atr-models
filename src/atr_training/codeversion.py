"""Which commit the running code came from (#147).

The training service is imported from a git checkout on every host it runs on —
an editable install on asteraix, ``PYTHONPATH=$REPO/src`` inside the UBELIX
container — so the checkout's ``HEAD`` *is* the code. It is read once per
process: a checkout that changes underneath a running process does not change
the modules already imported, so re-reading it later would describe code the
process is not running.

Never raises. A host without git, or code that is not in a checkout, yields a
:class:`CodeVersion` with ``commit=None``, and callers record that as unknown.

"""On-disk job store — the single source of truth for a training run.

A job lives entirely in its directory::

    <root>/<job_id>/
        job.json          the TrainJob record (atomically replaced)
        data/             materialized pages, manifests, .arrow datasets

        model/            promoted weights + metadata.json
        logs/<stage>.log  one log per stage

Nothing about a job is held only in the service's memory. The runner is a
**detached** child (``start_new_session=True``), so restarting ``atr-train`` must
reconcile against what is on disk and what is still running — never kill the run
and never assume it survived (:meth:`JobStore.reconcile`).

"""Publishing trained models to the HuggingFace Hub.

The register stage leaves one directory per trained model under
``TrainerSettings.trained_root`` (``~/atr-cache/trained/<model_id>/``): the
weights of that run's **best validation checkpoint** — kraken's
``best_<val_metric>.mlmodel``, or the VLM backend's adapter — plus a
``metadata.json`` holding the job id, the request that produced it and the CER
the test stage measured. That directory is everything a hub repo needs, so
publishing is a scan of ``trained_root`` and an upload per directory; nothing
here reaches back into the job store.

Three rules, the same ones the rest of this subsystem follows:

* **A model without ``metadata.json`` is not published.** A bare weights file
  cannot say what it was trained on or how well it scored, and a model card that
  guesses is worse than no upload — cf. the closest-reading rule the metrics
  carry. Such a directory is reported as skipped, never silently ignored.
* **Repos are created private by default.** Uploading is outward-facing and
  irreversible in practice (the hub keeps history); making a repo public is a
  separate, explicit decision, and so is choosing its licence.
* **One model's failure does not stop the others.** ``publish_all`` isolates
  each upload, because a rate limit or a name clash on the fourth of nine models
  must not cost the five that would have succeeded.

Like every module in this package this one is importable with pydantic + pyyaml
+ stdlib alone: ``huggingface_hub`` is reached through :class:`HubUploader`,
which imports it lazily, and the tests drive an :class:`Uploader` fake instead.

Entry point: ``scripts/publish_to_hub.py``.

"""``config/models.local.yaml`` — the gitignored registry overlay.

Models we train locally are registered here, never in the tracked
``config/models.yaml``: that file is a reviewed artifact describing models the
project has vetted, and a machine appending to it would erase that distinction.

Two rules, both learned from #30/#31 (the registry confidently advertising models
the host could not run):

* an id clash between the tracked registry and the overlay is a **hard error**,
  not a silent shadow — you cannot tell which model answered otherwise;
* an overlay entry is ``enabled: false`` until it has been served successfully
  once (the promotion gate in #36), and disabled entries are not merged.

Wiring this into ``load_registry`` / ``/models`` belongs to #36; this module only
reads, writes and merges.

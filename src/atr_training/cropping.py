"""Line cropping: cut transcribed TextLines out of their page scans.

``vlm_dataset.Sample`` carries a bbox (computed by :func:`line_boxes`) and a path
to the page scan. This module owns the pixel half of that contract: open one page
at a time (samples arrive grouped by page — caching all decoded scans is
gigabytes of RAM), clamp the bbox to the page, crop, and write a JPEG.

PIL is a **gateway dependency** (``pyproject.toml``), so this can live in the
shared training core and is unit-testable in the repo venv.

Public API
----------
``write_crops(samples, root, dest) -> list[Sample]``
    Cut each sample's bbox out of its page and return repointed samples.
    Samples without a bbox pass through unchanged (page-granularity samples).

    root: Path | str,
    dest: Path | str,
) -> list[Sample]:
    """Crop each sample's bbox from its page scan and write a JPEG.

    The source image path (``sample.image``) is resolved relative to ``root``.
    The crop is written under ``dest`` with a zero-padded index filename so
    training pipelines can enumerate them deterministically.

    The bbox is **clamped to the page** before cropping. Without clamping, PIL
    pads an out-of-bounds box with black, and a padded band of black is a worse
    training signal than a slightly tighter crop. Transkribus polygons routinely
    overrun the page edge once padding is added; the same clamp is tested in
    the VLM pipeline suite.

    Parameters
    ----------
    samples
        Samples as returned by :func:`vlm_dataset.samples_for`. Samples with
        ``bbox=None`` (page-granularity) are returned unchanged.
    root
        Job root: the directory under which ``sample.image`` is relative.
    dest
        Directory to write crops into. Created if it does not exist.

    Returns
    -------
    list[Sample]
        Samples with the same text/source_type/page, but ``image`` repointed to
        the crop path (relative to ``root``) and ``bbox=None``.

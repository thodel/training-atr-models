"""Trainer-service configuration (env prefix ``ATR_TRAIN_``).

Kept separate from the gateway's :class:`atr_serving.config.Settings`: the
trainer owns paths and guards the gateway has no business knowing about, and it
runs in its own venv.

Both classes use ``extra="ignore"``, which matters because the prefixes overlap —
the gateway reads ``ATR_TRAIN_URL`` as its ``train_url`` (#35) and this class
would otherwise see it as an unknown ``url``.

One instance of this service supervises **every** training backend; which
interpreter and runner module a job gets is looked up per engine in
:mod:`atr_training.backends`.

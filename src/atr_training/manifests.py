"""Manifests and the train/val split.

kraken ≥6 does not take globs: ``ketos compile -F`` and ``ketos train -t/-e`` all
want a **file containing paths, one per line**. Compiled datasets are passed the
same way — a manifest whose single line is the ``.arrow`` path, with
``-f binary``.

The split is **document-grouped and seeded**. Splitting at line level would put
lines from the same page on both sides; splitting at page level puts pages of the
same *manuscript* on both sides, which is the same mistake one level up — one
hand, one ink, one layout, often the same words. It was measured on
``20260915T191232Z-qwen3vl-german-pages-v4``: 416 of its 438 validation documents
were also in its training set, 95 % (#135).

    ``partition`` is the *train* fraction, matching ketos' ``-p``, and it is still
    counted in **pages**: documents are shuffled with the seed and taken into
    train until the next one would overshoot that fraction. Counting in documents
    instead would make the validation size swing with manuscript length, which is
    the thing that varies most here — Königsfelden charters run to a few folios,
    the Rats- und Richtebücher to over a thousand pages.

    Both sides are guaranteed non-empty. A page whose name carries no document id
    is its own document, so a corpus this cannot group (line crops, or any naming
    other than ``<index>_<docId>_…``) falls back to the page-level split it had
    before, and says so in the log — an optimistic number that announces itself is

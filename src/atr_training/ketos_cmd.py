"""``ketos`` argv builders and output parsers (kraken 7.0.2).

Every flag here was read off the kraken **7.0.2** sources, not the docs on
``kraken.re`` (which document 7.1 and list flags this box does not have, e.g.
``--arch ppocrv6`` and ``--linetype``). Long option names are used throughout:
they are self-documenting in ``journalctl``, and they sidestep the trap that
``-s`` means ``--seed`` on the ``ketos`` group but ``--spec`` on ``train``.

Device convention: the unit sets ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1``, so physical GPU 1 is
addressed as ``cuda:0`` inside the process.

#: Why ``--schedule 1cycle`` cannot be used on kraken 7.0.2 (#96).
#:
#: ``kraken/train/vgsl.py`` passes ``len_train_set=len(datamodule.train_set)`` —
#: a count of **samples** — into ``OneCycleLR(steps_per_epoch=...)``, which wants
#: optimizer steps. The cycle therefore comes out ``batch_size`` times too long:
#: shard_00 at 30 epochs produced ``total_steps`` 24,951,540 against 97,470 real
#: steps, and that figure was *identical* at batch 64 and batch 256, which is the
#: fingerprint. ``OneCycleLR`` starts at ``max_lr / 25`` and warms up over the
#: first 30 % of the cycle, so the warmup would end after ~2,304 epochs: run 2
#: moved from 4.000e-05 to 4.324e-05 in 85 epochs and 27 hours, and the annealing
#: phase — the whole point of 1cycle — is never reached.
#:
#: So ``--lrate`` has silently meant ``lrate / 25``, held roughly constant, for
#: every kraken run this project has done.

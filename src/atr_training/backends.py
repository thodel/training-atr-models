"""Which runner, in which venv, for which engine.

There is **one** training service (``atr-train`` on :8204) supervising every
backend, not one per engine. That is not tidiness — it is the GPU. Training and
inference do not share a card politely (docs/TRAINING_PLAN.md §5), so exactly one
training job may run at a time; two services would each enforce
``max_concurrent=1`` against their own job list and cheerfully start a kraken run
and a VLM run into the same 45 GB. One supervisor, one queue, one guard.

The isolation the engines *do* need is the venv: kraken pins ``kraken==7.0.2``
with ``datasets<4``, while the VLM trainer needs ``transformers`` new enough for
Qwen3-VL plus peft/trl/bitsandbytes. Those cannot share a dependency tree — the
same reason the serving engines each have their own (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN §3).

So the supervisor stays dependency-free and each job is spawned as a **detached
child of the right interpreter**::

    .venvs/kraken-train/bin/python -m kraken_train_svc.runner --root … --job-id …
    .venvs/vlm-train/bin/python    -m vlm_train_svc.runner    --root … --job-id …

Nothing in either engine package is ever imported by the service, so a broken or
missing VLM venv cannot stop kraken jobs from running (and vice versa).

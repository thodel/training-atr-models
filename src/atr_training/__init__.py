"""Training subsystem — the dependency-light core (issue #33).

Everything in this package is importable with **pydantic + pyyaml + stdlib only**,
exactly like :mod:`atr_serving.contracts`. No torch, no kraken, no ``datasets``.

That is deliberate: the engine venvs are not importable from the test suite (the
repo venv has no torch), so all the logic that is worth testing — argv building,
PageXML rewriting, dataset selection, split determinism, the job state machine —
lives here and is unit-tested in the repo venv. ``engines/kraken_train_svc``
(issue #34) and ``engines/vlm_train_svc`` are thin glue that import this package
via ``PYTHONPATH=…/src``, the same way the other engine services get
:mod:`atr_serving.contracts`.

Two backends share all of it — the job store, the state machine, the five stage
names, the resource guards and the whole prepare stage. What differs is
``params`` and the commands each ``compile``/``train``/``test`` stage issues
(:mod:`~atr_training.ketos_cmd` vs :mod:`~atr_training.vlm_cmd`).

Design: `serving-atr-inference/docs/TRAINING_PLAN.md`; the VLM backend, `serving-atr-inference/docs/VLM_TRAINING.md`.

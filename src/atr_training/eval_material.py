"""Is the ground truth plausible? — auditing materialized pages before trusting a CER.

Written for #52. Every model trained here so far, CTC and autoregressive alike,
has produced **more characters than the reference contains**:

    kraken-thun-missiven-v1   CER 0.9838   11,191 insertions   2 deletions

That asymmetry is the whole clue, and it points away from the model. An
undertrained CTC network collapses to blank and predicts *nothing*, which scores
as **deletions**. Insertions outnumbering deletions 5,000:1 is the opposite
failure: the reference is shorter than what the image actually contains.

So before scoring a known-good model against this material (the expensive half of
#52), ask the material a question it can answer on its own: **how many pixels of
line is each reference character supposed to account for?**

For handwriting at these resolutions a character occupies very roughly 15–40 px of
line width. A line 800 px wide with a 5-character transcription implies 160 px per
character, which no hand produces — that line is cropped from an image containing
far more text than its reference admits to. One such line is a typo; a
distribution centred there means the ground truth is not aligned with the images,
and no amount of training will fix it.

Pure: stdlib plus :mod:`atr_training.pagexml`. It reads the PageXML the
prepare stage already wrote, so it needs no GPU, no model and no network.

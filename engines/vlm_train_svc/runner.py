"""The VLM stage bodies: compile → train → test → register.

Same lifecycle, same job store, same detached-child contract and the *same*
``prepare`` stage as kraken — all of that is
:class:`atr_training.runner_base.BasePipeline`. What differs is the four
stages below:

===========  =====================================  =============================
stage        kraken                                 vllm (here)
===========  =====================================  =============================
prepare      HF rows → ``pages/*.{jpg,xml}``        *identical* — shared code
compile      ``ketos compile`` → ``.arrow``         crop lines → ``*.jsonl``
train        ``ketos train`` → ``best_*.mlmodel``   QLoRA → LoRA adapter dir
test         ``ketos test`` → CER from the report   generate + score → CER
register     copy weights, trained/<id>.yaml        copy adapter, trained/<id>.yaml
===========  =====================================  =============================

``compile`` runs in-process because cropping is PIL and a subprocess per page
would cost more than the crop. ``train`` and ``test`` are subprocesses so a CUDA
OOM kills a child, not the runner that has to record why.

Invoked as::

    python -m vlm_train_svc.runner --root <jobs_root> --job-id <id>

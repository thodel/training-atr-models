"""QLoRA fine-tune of a Qwen3-VL base on compiled HTR samples.

Run as a subprocess by ``vlm_train_svc.runner``; every argument is built by
:func:`atr_training.vlm_cmd.train_cmd`, which is unit-tested, so this
module is the only place that needs torch and never has to guess at defaults.

    python -m vlm_train_svc.train_qlora --base-model … --train-jsonl … --output-dir …

Why a subprocess and not an import: a CUDA OOM here takes the process down, and
the runner that has to write *why* onto the job record must survive it.

The recipe is ``lassberg/vlm_training`` (4-bit NF4 + double quant, LoRA on the
attention and FFN projections, paged 8-bit Adam, gradient checkpointing), with
the source-aware visual-token budget carried per sample as ``source_type``.

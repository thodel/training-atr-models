"""Training service (:8204) — supervises every training backend.

Supervision only: it never trains in-process, and never imports an engine
package. Submitting a job writes a record, and a scheduler loop starts it as a
**detached** child *of that engine's interpreter* when the GPU is free and
nothing else is running. State lives in the job directory, so a restart of this
service reconciles against reality instead of losing (or killing) a run.

One service for both backends is a deliberate choice about the GPU rather than
about tidiness — see :mod:`atr_training.backends`. The package is still
named ``kraken_train_svc`` because kraken was the first backend; the service is
``atr-train`` and the API is engine-agnostic.

Endpoints mirror what the gateway proxies in #35:

    POST   /jobs              submit            → 202 {job_id}
    POST   /jobs/verify       check a dataset spec, queue nothing
    GET    /jobs              list
    GET    /jobs/{id}         one record
    GET    /jobs/{id}/log     tail a stage log
    GET    /jobs/{id}/curve   per-epoch metrics, live while training
    POST   /jobs/{id}/cancel  SIGTERM the process group
    DELETE /jobs/{id}         drop artifacts (never the registered model)
    GET    /gpu               this machine's cards and who holds them
    GET    /gpu-claim         whether a job holds the training card
    GET    /health            the only route without a key

Every route but ``/health`` needs ``X-API-Key`` and every caller must be
loopback or in ``ATR_TRAIN_ALLOWED_CLIENTS`` (#13, :mod:`atr_training.access`).
Start it with ``python -m atr_training.serve``, which refuses an unsafe bind.

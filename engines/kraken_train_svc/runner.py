"""The kraken stage bodies: compile → train → test → register.

The lifecycle, the stage bookkeeping and the ``prepare`` stage are shared with
every other backend (:class:`atr_training.runner_base.BasePipeline`);
what lives here is the four stages that are actually about ketos.

Heavy imports (kraken, ``htrmopo``) are deliberately kept out of module scope —
they are behind the ketos subprocesses and one lazy import — so this pipeline is
importable and testable in the repo venv with fakes, without a GPU or a network.

Invoked as::

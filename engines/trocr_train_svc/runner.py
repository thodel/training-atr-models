"""The TrOCR stage bodies: compile → train → test → register.

Mirrors :class:`vlm_train_svc.runner.Pipeline` at ``granularity="line"`` but
with TrOCR fine-tuning (microsoft/trocr-* or dh-unibe/* variants) instead
of QLoRA. The ``_compile`` stage is structurally identical to the VLM backend's
line-level path — both crop pages to lines and write a JSONL manifest — so
any divergence there is a bug, not a feature.

The same lifecycle, same job store, same detached-child contract and the *same*
``prepare`` stage as every other backend (:class:`atr_training.runner_base.BasePipeline`).
What differs is the four stages below.

Heavy imports (``torch``, ``transformers``) are kept **inside functions**, not
at module scope, so this pipeline is importable and testable in the repo venv
with fakes — no GPU and no torch in the test path.

Invoked as::

    python -m trocr_train_svc.runner --root <jobs_root> --job-id <id>

Naming (#44): this package is ``trocr_train_svc`` and its scripts are
``train_trocr`` / ``evaluate_trocr``. The branch that first proposed this backend
called everything ``trocraft`` while still spawning ``trocr_train_svc.…``, so the
subprocess named a module that did not exist. ``trocr`` won for four reasons that
all point the same way: it is the model family (Microsoft's TrOCR), issue #44
specifies ``engines/trocr_train_svc`` and ``.venvs/trocr-train``, the serving side
is already ``engines/trocr_svc`` with ``trocr-*`` ids in the registry, and #43's
``training/trocr_cmd`` — on main, with tests — already declares
``TRAIN_MODULE = "trocr_train_svc.train_trocr"``. "trocraft" appears nowhere else
in the repo, the issue, or the literature.

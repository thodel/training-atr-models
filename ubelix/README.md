# Running this trainer on UBELIX

> **Names.** These files predate the renaming of 16.09.2026. Where they say
> "asterAIx" about measurements, the in-repo trainer or GPU indices, they mean

The same VLM training subsystem as on asterAIx, driven by **Slurm** instead of the
`atr-train` service. Nothing in `src/` or `engines/` changes — everything here is
environment and job plumbing. Full context and cost estimates:
[`UBELIX_PLAN.md`](https://github.com/thodel/serving-atr-inference/blob/main/docs/UBELIX_PLAN.md) (in the serving repo, where this directory came from).

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `vlm-train.def` | Apptainer image: Ubuntu 24.04 + python3.12 + torch 2.8.0+cu128, mirroring `docs/idhefix-environment.md`. The repo is **not** baked in — it is bind-mounted, so code edits need no rebuild. |
| `submit_job.py` | The one thing the service did that the runner cannot: turn a JSON `TrainRequest` into a `JobStore` record. |
| `smoke.sbatch` | Phase 1: reproduce the Thun run on 1× RTX 4090, free QoS. |
| `report.py` | Print a finished job's status / metrics / error. |
| `specs/*.json` | Job requests, the same body `POST /train/jobs` takes. |

## Setup (once)

```bash
ssh ubelix
git clone https://github.com/thodel/training-atr-models.git ~/training-atr-models
# ~/ubelix holds what is NOT code: the .sif images, logs/ and your specs/.
# The job scripts and their Python helpers are run from the checkout, never copied.
mkdir -p ~/ubelix/logs ~/ubelix/specs && cp ~/training-atr-models/ubelix/specs/*.json ~/ubelix/specs/
export APPTAINER_TMPDIR=/scratch/network/users/$USER/apptainer/tmp
export APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=/scratch/network/users/$USER/apptainer/cache
mkdir -p "$APPTAINER_TMPDIR" "$APPTAINER_CACHEDIR"

# Build from the REPO ROOT: the def's %files path is relative to the build CWD.
cd ~/training-atr-models
apptainer build ~/ubelix/vlm-train.sif ubelix/vlm-train.def   # ~10 min, 4.1 GB
```

Build on a **login node**: compute nodes may lack internet, login nodes have it.
The `.sif` belongs in `$HOME` — 1 TB private quota, snapshotted. Not the share
(group quota, 88 % full), not scratch (30-day purge).

## A Slurm job does not register its model

The register stage writes the weights and `metadata.json` to
`ATR_TRAIN_TRAINED_ROOT` (on UBELIX: `/scratch/network/users/$USER/runs/trained`)
and then **leaves the shared registry alone** (#17) — no disable of an existing
registration, no new one, no promotion gate. The registry's `/mnt/…` path does not
exist on UBELIX, and idhefix could not open a scratch path anyway. The job still
ends `completed`, with `promoted: false`. Its record says so in `registration`, with the YAML to write
by hand:

```bash
python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(open(sys.argv[1]))['registration'])" \
    /scratch/network/users/$USER/runs/jobs/<job-id>/job.json
```

Until asteraix registers finished Slurm jobs itself (#17), copy the weights
directory to `…/Textrecognition_Training/trained-ubelix/` on the share and register
from there.

## Standard procedure: two stages

**Always split the run.** `prepare` and `compile` are network, CPU and disk —
streaming pages, parsing PageXML, cutting crops, writing JSONL — and on a real
corpus that is hours. None of it touches a GPU. Doing it inside a GPU allocation
wastes the scarce half of the machine, and on UBELIX doubly so: the GPU job may
wait two days to start and would then spend its first three hours not using the
GPU it waited for.

```bash
# 1. plan the corpus — never hand-pick projects (VLM_TRAINING.md §2).
#    plan_corpus.py has not moved yet (#6): until it does, run this from a checkout
#    of serving-atr-inference, i.e. REPO=~/serving-atr-inference for this step only.
apptainer exec --bind /storage/research --bind /scratch --bind /rs_scratch \
  --env HF_HOME=$HF_HOME --env PYTHONPATH=$REPO/src:$REPO/engines \
  ~/ubelix/vlm-train.sif python scripts/plan_corpus.py \
    --org dh-unibe --period 1300 1600 --max-share 0.45 \
    --eval-repo <repo> --eval-project <p> --exclude-project <p> \
    --json ~/ubelix/specs/<name>.json --engine vllm --model-id <id>

# 2. add the measured training params to that spec (see the table below)

# 0. ALWAYS first: the job runs the code this checkout holds when it STARTS
cd ~/training-atr-models && git pull

# 3. STAGE 1 — build the corpus on a free CPU node, no GPU
ubelix/submit.sh ubelix/prepare.sbatch ~/ubelix/specs/<name>.json

# 4. STAGE 2 — train it on one H100, not preemptable, inside job_gratis's cap
JOB_ID=<id from stage 1> ubelix/submit.sh ubelix/train.sbatch -- \
    --partition=gpu --qos=job_gratis --cpus-per-task=12 --time=15:00:00
```

`submit.sh` refuses a checkout behind `origin/main` or with uncommitted changes,
and a request above `job_gratis`'s 11,520 CPU-minutes — each has already cost a run
(serving-atr-inference#147).

**The code is pinned.** `submit.sh` exports `ATR_CODE_COMMIT` (HEAD at submission),
and every batch file runs a git worktree of exactly that commit
(`ubelix/pin_code.sh`). A job that queues for two days, is preempted and
requeued, or is chained from another job runs what was submitted, whatever has
been pulled since. The job record names the commit in `code`, per stage.

- Run an older commit on purpose: `ATR_CODE_COMMIT=<sha> ubelix/submit.sh …`
- Run the working tree as it is, uncommitted edits included: `ATR_UNPINNED=1 ubelix/submit.sh …`
- Plain `sbatch` is unpinned too, and the job log says so in capitals.
- Worktrees live in `~/.cache/training-atr-models/worktrees/<sha>` and are never
  removed automatically (a requeued job may need one):
  `git -C ~/training-atr-models worktree list`, then `worktree remove <dir>`.

Stage 1 leaves the job in `training` — **the same state a preemption leaves it
in** — so stage 2 takes the ordinary resume path and there is no second contract
to keep correct. Nothing is re-streamed, so the seeded split stays the one the
corpus was built with; re-preparing would rebuild it and quietly invalidate the
CER.

Compute nodes have internet (verified: `huggingface.co → 200` from `bnode009`),
so corpora need not be pre-cached on the share.

### The HF token (do this once)

Without one, `prepare` is rate-limited as an anonymous IP and dies mid-stream on
any corpus with many project directories:

```
429 … We had to rate limit your IP (130.92.232.126) … make sure you pass a HF_TOKEN
```

The `hf` CLI is inside the container, not on the login node. But **do not run
`hf auth login`**: it writes to `$HF_HOME/token`, and `HF_HOME` here points at the
**group-readable research share**, so the token would be exposed to everyone in
`wbkolleg_dh_1`. Put it in a private file in `$HOME` instead — the jobs read it
from there:

```bash
umask 077
read -rs -p 'HF token: ' T && printf '%s' "$T" > ~/.hf_token && unset T && echo
chmod 600 ~/.hf_token
echo "saved $(wc -c < ~/.hf_token) bytes"      # must NOT be 0
```

**Check the byte count.** The first attempt here produced a 0-byte file — the silent
prompt accepted an empty line — and nothing noticed, because the jobs only checked
that the file was *readable*. They now require a non-empty `hf_…` token and say so
in their log; the trainer's *"You are sending unauthenticated requests"* warning is
the other tell.

Every sbatch here picks it up automatically and reports `HF token: present` or
`ABSENT` in its log.

*Partial mitigation without a token:* a selection that covers **every** project in
a repo collapses to one glob (`collapse_complete_selection`, #89), so
`all_projects: true` avoids the per-project calls. It only helps when taking the
whole repo is what you want — `plan_corpus` deduplicates, which makes selections
incomplete and re-exposes the problem.

### The measured configuration

Every value comes from an experiment in [`UBELIX_PLAN.md`](https://github.com/thodel/serving-atr-inference/blob/main/docs/UBELIX_PLAN.md) §9, not from taste:

| param | value | why |
|---|---|---|
| `base_model` | `Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct` | 4B matches 8B at half the size (§9.3-B) |
| `load_in_4bit` | `false` | bf16 is +23 % on a card we own (§9.3-A) |
| `batch_size` | `16` | **the** bottleneck: 51 % → 86 % GPU utilization (§9.3-G) |
| `max_pixels` | `262144` | 256 visual tokens; 128 ties, 512 is worse (§9.3-D) |
| `workers` | `8` | 4/8/16 indistinguishable (§9.3-F) |
| `save_steps` | `200` | bounds the work a preemption costs |
| `epochs` | `1` | the runbook's rule at corpus scale |

**Do not stage crops to `/scratch/local`.** It is measurably neutral (−0.5 %) and
costs 10–31 h of copying at full scale (§9.2).

## Run

Use `submit.sh`, not `sbatch` — it checks the checkout and the CPU-minute cap, and validates the spec, on the login node first. Extra `sbatch` options go after `--`.
`submit_job.py` does validate, but it runs *inside* the batch job, so a bad spec
costs a queue wait and a GPU allocation before anything says so (job 14431367
died 13 s in over a capital letter in a `model_id`).

```bash
cd ~/training-atr-models
ubelix/submit.sh ubelix/experiment_a.sbatch
ubelix/submit.sh ubelix/smoke.sbatch
squeue -u $USER
tail -f ~/ubelix/logs/vlm-smoke-<jobid>.out
```

## Checking progress from the laptop

```bash
./ubelix/status.sh            # queue, recent jobs, quota, newest log, metrics
./ubelix/status.sh -f         # follow the newest job's log
./ubelix/status.sh -j 14108981 -n 60
```

Read-only, and it goes through the `ubelix` ssh alias (ProxyJump via idhefix, alias `srv-train`), so it
needs no VPN.

If idhefix is down, that route dies with it. On the UniBE VPN, `submit02` is reachable
directly — use the `ubelix-direct` alias, or `UBELIX_HOST=ubelix-direct ./ubelix/status.sh`.

## Paying for GPUs — short version: don't, for H100s

Checked 2026-08-27 against the internal price page and `sacctmgr show qos`:

* **H100 CHF 0.60/h, RTX 4090 CHF 0.10/h**, per-minute billing.
* **Preemptable and debug jobs are free**, project or no project.
* The free `job_gpu_preemptable` QoS grants **h100=4**. The paid `job_gpu` QoS
  grants **h100=1**. Paying gets you *fewer* H100s, not more — more than 4
  needs an investment, and GPU investments are closed until the 2026 DC expansion.

So the free 4× H100 preemptable path is both cheaper and ~3× faster than anything
purchasable. A project is still worth having for the **F2 free tier** (up to
CHF 1000/year refunded per cost centre — the whole campaign is ~CHF 510) and so that
a billed RTX 4090 fallback is a header edit rather than a procurement. Ordered by the
institute's IT-responsible person at `iamportal.unibe.ch` → "HPC - Order new Project
Space". See [`UBELIX_PLAN.md`](https://github.com/thodel/serving-atr-inference/blob/main/docs/UBELIX_PLAN.md) (in the serving repo, where this directory came from) §4.3.

```bash
#SBATCH --account=gratis              # the primary path: free, 4x H100, killable
#SBATCH --partition=gpu-invest
#SBATCH --qos=job_gpu_preemptable
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:h100:4
```

## Long runs: preemption and resume

`train_resumable.sbatch` is the template for anything that will not finish inside
one allocation. Three things have to line up, and all three are in the script:

* `--requeue`, so Slurm puts the job back rather than ending it;
* a **stable training job id** across attempts, written once and read back from
  `$SCRATCH/runs/slurm-$SLURM_JOB_ID.jobid` — without it each attempt creates a
  new job, compiles a new corpus with a **new seeded split**, and starts at zero;
* `ATR_TRAIN_PREEMPTABLE=1`, so the runner treats SIGTERM as "resume later"
  rather than "cancelled" and leaves the record in `training`.

Set `save_steps` in the spec. The default (0) checkpoints once per epoch, which
is right when an epoch is minutes and useless when it is days.

**Two interruption modes, and they behave differently.** On preemption or
`scontrol requeue`, Slurm kills the step promptly — there is no time to shut
down, and what keeps the job resumable is that nothing writes a terminal status
(`JobStore.save` is tmp-then-`os.replace`, so a hard kill cannot corrupt the
record). At **walltime**, `--signal=B:TERM@120` gives 120 seconds and the
graceful path runs. Both end in the same place; only the second logs about it.

Verify a resume by three lines: `resuming from …/checkpoint-N` (trainer log),
`re-entered while \`training\`` (runner log), and the same job id on both
attempts (batch log).

## Four things that differ from asterAIx

All of them are set in `smoke.sbatch`; copy that header for any new job.

1. `--mem` is rejected without `--nodes`.
2. `/scratch/network` symlinks to `/rs_scratch`; Apptainer must bind **both**.
3. `ATR_TRAIN_VENVS_ROOT=/opt` — the venv is `/opt/vlm-train` in the container.
4. `ATR_TRAIN_GPU=0` — Slurm's allocated GPU is index 0, not asterAIx's 1.

## Where things go

Read the dataset and base models from the share; write everything else to scratch.
See [`UBELIX_PLAN.md`](https://github.com/thodel/serving-atr-inference/blob/main/docs/UBELIX_PLAN.md) (in the serving repo, where this directory came from) §5.1 for the full policy — the
short version is that scratch holds only what we can rebuild, and the split manifest
is what makes rebuilding possible.

"""Clone one prepared job into several, one per base model, sharing one corpus.

    fanout.py <jobs_root> <prepared_job_id> <model_id>=<base_model> ...

prints one job id per line, each ready for ``train.sbatch``.

WHY. There is no DDP, so parallel jobs are how more than one GPU gets used, and a
model comparison is the obvious thing to parallelise. But stage 2 resumes a
single job id and a job has a single ``base_model`` — so N models naively means N
full prepares of the same corpus. On the German corpus that is 2 h of prepare and
28 GB / 325,651 crop files each. Worse than the cost: each prepare re-derives the
seeded split, and a comparison across four splits is four experiments, not one.

HOW. Each clone gets a job record identical to the prepared one except for
``base_model`` and ``model_id``, advanced to ``training`` so ``train.sbatch``
takes the ordinary resume path. Its ``data/`` is a REAL directory holding
symlinks to the prepared job's inputs — never a symlink to the whole ``data/``:
the test stage writes ``data/eval_report.json`` (vlm_train_svc/runner.py), and
four arms writing one report would each read back whichever CER landed last.

The compiled JSONL names crops as ``data/crops/<role>/<n>.jpg`` relative to the
job root, so ``<clone>/data/crops`` → symlink resolves to the shared tree.

Every clone is stamped ``host: ubelix``, whatever the source says, for the reason
``submit_job.py`` stamps it: ``train.sbatch`` runs them, and no trainer may (#15).

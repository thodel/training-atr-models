# 1. preflight.py refuses a submission that is known to fail or to run the wrong
#    code: a checkout behind origin/main (the container imports the code when the
#    job STARTS — two runs were lost to that), or CPUs x walltime above the QoS
#    cap (job_gratis: 11,520 CPU-minutes, GPU jobs included). #147.
# 2. A spec, if the job takes one, is validated here rather than inside the batch
#    job — a bad spec otherwise costs a queue wait and an allocation before
#    anything says so. Job 14431367 died 13 s in on a capital letter in model_id.
# 3. The validated spec is what the job receives: SPEC is exported and sbatch
#    passes the environment through. Without that, a file with SPEC=${SPEC:?}
#    died in 0 s (prep 15207246), and a file with a default SPEC silently ran the
#    default instead of the spec that was validated.

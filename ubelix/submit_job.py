"""Create a training job record on disk, without the atr-train service.

On asterAIx a job is born from ``POST /train/jobs``; the service writes the
record and spawns the runner. UBELIX has no service and no systemd — Slurm is
the supervisor. This shim does the one thing the service did that the runner
cannot do for itself: turn a JSON request into a JobStore record.

    python submit_job.py spec.json        -> prints the job id

The runner is then invoked exactly as the service would:

    python -m vlm_train_svc.runner --root $ATR_TRAIN_JOBS_ROOT --job-id <id>

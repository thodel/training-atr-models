# Architecture search — how to run it, and what to search over

Companion to issue #91. This document answers two questions: *which* search
procedure, and *which* parameters. Both answers come from the computer-vision
literature plus what this box has already measured.

## 1. Don't brute-force. The literature says why.

A full grid over the axes in §3 is ~600 configurations at 5–70 min per epoch. It is
also the wrong shape of search:

* **Random beats grid.** Bergstra & Bengio (JMLR 2012) show grid search wastes trials
  on dimensions that do not matter: search spaces are high-dimensional but their
  *effective* dimensionality is low — a few hyperparameters account for most of the
  variance. Random search finds equal or better models in a fraction of the compute,
  and parallelises trivially.
* **Don't train losers to completion.** Successive Halving / Hyperband / ASHA give
  every configuration a small budget, keep the top 1/η, multiply the budget by η, and
  repeat. Reported speedups are an order of magnitude over Bayesian optimisation and
  ≥10× over random search alone.

**Our own runs confirm that early ranking works here.** run 3 (kraken default) reached
val 0.7057 at **epoch 3**; run 2 was at 0.308 at epoch 7. The final ordering
(0.8226 vs 0.7809) was visible in the first three epochs, at ~4% of the compute
eventually spent.

The caveat is equally visible in our data: kraken+ vs run 2 differ by only 0.03 at
epoch 18. **Small gaps need high rungs; large gaps are settled at rung 1.** That is
exactly what successive halving does, and it is why a single fixed budget per config
is the wrong design.

### Proposed schedule (η = 3)

| rung | budget | configs | screening shard | wall clock |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 3 epochs | 45 | 2,500 pages | ~4 min/epoch → ~9 h |
| 1 | 9 epochs | 15 | 5,000 pages | ~8 min/epoch → ~18 h |
| 2 | 27 epochs | 5 | `shard_00` (24,744) | ~20–70 min/epoch → ~3 d |
| 3 | to plateau | 2 | `shard_00` | until early stop |

Rungs 0–1 rank; rung 2 confirms; rung 3 produces a model. Only rung 3 output is ever
published. **Rank inversion between small and large data is the known failure mode** —
small sets favour small models — so promotion is never the final word.

## 2. Fairness rules (each one is a bug we already hit)

1. **Equal epochs *are* equal compute once rule 2 holds — do not "improve" on this.**
   The original wording was "fixed optimizer-step budget, not fixed epochs", motivated
   by run 3's epoch being 4× run 2's after an OOM forced batch 64. Implemented
   literally in the first height sweep, the budget was computed as
   `epochs × lines / micro_batch` — which counts **micro-batches, not optimizer
   steps**. Gradient accumulation was never divided out:

   | | micro-batches | accum | actual optimizer steps |
   |---|---:|---:|---:|
   | h48, 4 epochs | 12,996 | 1 | **12,996** |
   | h120, 1 epoch | 12,996 | 4 | **3,249** |

   The tall configurations ran on a quarter of the budget and returned val 0.27
   against 0.55–0.65 for the short ones — which reads as "tall is far worse" and means
   "undertrained". Rerun at four epochs each, that same h120 reaches **0.7154**, the
   best of the sweep.

   Rule 2 already fixes the *effective* batch, and then
   `optimizer steps = lines × epochs / effective_batch` — nothing else enters, so equal
   epochs are equal steps by construction. Fix a step budget only where the effective
   batch genuinely varies, and count it as `micro_batches / accumulation`, which is what
   Lightning's `global_step` records and what the checkpoints can be checked against.
2. **Fixed *effective* batch, micro-batch found per config.** run 3 OOMed at 256 where
   run 2 did not — activation memory, not parameters. Probe the largest micro-batch
   that fits, then set `--accumulate-grad-batches` to reach the common effective batch.
   The linear scaling rule (batch ↔ LR) means an uncontrolled batch silently changes
   the learning rate too.
3. **`--quit dumb` with a fixed epoch count in rungs 0–2.** `--epochs` only sizes the
   schedule; `--quit early` decides when to stop. run 2 spent ~18 of its 27 hours
   training with no improvement — written here as "after the LR had annealed to zero",
   which was wrong in the opposite direction: under `1cycle` the rate never annealed at
   all, it rose from 4.000e-05 to 4.324e-05 across 50 epochs (#96). Sweeps since
   2026-09-15 run `cosine`, which does anneal.
4. **From scratch, or vary base models — never mixed.** `--spec` is ignored when
   `--load` is given.
5. **One data version per sweep**, recorded. `shard_00.arrow` predates #89/#90 and
   still contains lines those fixes now drop.

## 3. Parameters, ranked by expected payoff

### Tier 1 — the axes with direct evidence

**Input height** — 48 / 64 / 96 / 120 / 128.
Scene-text CRNNs use 32; historical HTR implementations cluster at 60–128. Our only
controlled comparison is 64 (run 2, 0.7809) vs 120 (run 3, 0.8226). Strong prior, and
cheap to vary.

**Horizontal downsampling / frames per character** — total width stride 2 / 4 / 8,
and input height, which cannot be separated from it.
CTC cannot emit more labels than it has timesteps, and the literature warns
explicitly against reducing sequence length too far. The quantity that decides this
is scale-free — `width / (height × characters)` — because kraken normalises every
crop to the spec's input height and scales the width with it. Measured on
`val_clean.arrow` (6,319 lines): crops are a median 91 px tall at 33.1 px per
character, **aspect_per_char 0.326, p10 0.246**. That puts the two trained
architectures at:

| spec | height | stride | frames/char (p10) |
|---|---|---|---|
| run 2 (kraken+) | 64 | 8 | **1.97** |
| run 3 (default) | 120 | 8 | **3.69** |

So run 3 sees nearly **twice the horizontal resolution** of run 2 from the same
pages — a measured mechanism for part of the 0.7809 → 0.8226 gap, and an argument
that height and stride should be searched as one axis rather than two. Implemented
as S10 (`src/atr_training/vgsl_geometry.py`), which runs after `prepare` and refuses a spec
that leaves under 1.25 frames per character.

**Augmentation on/off** — `--augment`.
Random rotation and elastic distortion both beat the baseline on historical material
(≈3.6% relative CER in one ablation); affine + elastic are the two standard schemes.
Ströbel attributes his 1.6-point gap between kraken+ and HTR+ specifically to
pre-processing and augmentation. Neither of our runs used it. Highest-value single
switch we have not tried.

**Peak learning rate** — 3e-4 / 1e-3 / 3e-3, with warmup.
Measured here: 1e-4 from scratch under `1cycle` starts at 4e-6 and never escapes CTC
blank collapse; 1e-3 works. Both numbers are the *requested* rate: under `1cycle` the
run saw `lrate/25` throughout (#96), so what was really compared is **4e-6 against
4e-5**. The ranking stands, the values to sweep do not — under `cosine` the requested
rate is the rate. Warmup exists precisely because early parameters are far
from any solution and a large LR is unstable there.

### Tier 2 — plausible, cheap to include

**Recurrent width × depth** — `Lbx128/200/256/400` × 2/3/4 layers. The original CRNN
uses 256; implementations at higher horizontal resolution move to 512. Our two
architectures differ here (256×3 vs 200×3) but confounded with height, so it is
currently unmeasured.

**Dropout rate and placement** — 0.1 after conv blocks (kraken default) vs 0.5 after
each BLSTM (Ströbel/PyLaia). A factor of five apart, never compared on our data.

**Conv stack depth and widths** — 3 vs 4 blocks; 12/24/48/48 (PyLaia) vs 32/32/64/64
(kraken) vs 8/32/64 (kraken+).

**Output bottleneck** — the `Cr*,*,85` question from `docs/KRAKEN_PLUS.md`: 85 filters
before 102 classes is rank-limiting. Currently being measured.

### Tier 3 — worth one run each, not a sweep axis

* **Fine-tune vs from scratch.** Historically our largest single effect: 0.9838 → 0.3921
  on identical data (§9b). Any sweep result must be read against a fine-tuned baseline.
* **Label smoothing / cosine annealing.** Standard "bag of tricks" gains on
  classification; unverified for CTC.
* **Deformable convolutions**, reported to boost modern *and* historical HTR — not
  expressible in VGSL, so it would need a kraken fork. Park it.
* **Combining marks.** Neither model emits a single one of the 170 `Inherited`
  characters (nasal bars, superscript vowels). This is not an architecture-scale
  problem and will not be fixed by this sweep; it needs its own investigation.

## 4. What the sweep can realistically buy

Current best on our held-out medieval set: **CER 0.1335** (run 3). Published SOTA for
line-level CTC on IAM sits near 4.6–4.7% CER, TrOCR at 2.89%, and a multilingual
historical "supermodel" reports ~2.95% average — on cleaner, better-resourced material
than ours.

The gap is therefore not mostly architectural. Expect an architecture sweep to move
0.1335 into roughly the 0.09–0.11 range; expect augmentation, more data, and starting
from pretrained weights to matter more. The sweep is worth running because it is cheap
and mechanisable, not because it is where the remaining error lives.

## 6. Results — height sweep, rung 0 (2026-09-02)

`shard_00` / `val_clean`, kraken default architecture, **only the input height varies**.
Effective batch 256 throughout (the micro-batch shrinks with height because 120 px OOMs
at 256), 4 epochs = 12,996 optimizer steps each, lrate 1e-3, seed 42, `--no-augment`.

| height | micro × accum | val accuracy | frames/char (S10) | wall |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 48 | 256 × 1 | 0.5528 | 1.48 `warn` | 1 h 43 |
| 64 | 256 × 1 | 0.6475 | 1.97 `warn` | 2 h 34 |
| 96 | 128 × 2 | 0.6827 | 2.95 `ok` | 4 h 10 |
| 120 | 64 × 4 | 0.7154 | 3.69 `ok` | 5 h 28 |
| 128 | 64 × 4 | 0.7355 | 3.94 `ok` | 6 h 07 |
| 160 | 32 × 8 | 0.7326 | 4.92 `ok` | 8 h 43 |
| 192 | 32 × 8 | 0.7494 | 5.90 `ok` | 11 h 45 |
| 256 | 16 × 16 | **0.7515** | 7.87 `ok` | 19 h 55 |

**The trend rises across the whole range; the individual steps do not.** h160 comes in
at 0.7326, *below* h128's 0.7355. An earlier version of this section claimed "monotone:
every step up in height buys accuracy" on the basis of the first five heights, and h160
falsifies that wording.

The dip is 0.0029 and sits inside the ±0.005–0.01 band that plateau fluctuation showed in
earlier runs, so it is not evidence that 160 is *worse* than 128 — it is evidence that
single runs cannot resolve differences of this size. That matters beyond the wording:
the Arm A/Arm B pair differences below are 0.0104 and 0.0148, only three to five times
the noise floor, and they rest on one run each.

What survives is the shape: **+0.19 from h48 to h256**, with the two heights flagged
`warn` by S10 (under two CTC frames per character) as the two worst by a wide margin —
the 48→64 gap alone is 0.0947, larger than everything from 64 to 256 combined.

It also explains run 3 against run 2 retrospectively — **0.8226 vs 0.7809 was the
height, not the architecture**. kraken+ (`Cr1,1,85`, height 64) landing between them
supports the same reading; see `docs/KRAKEN_PLUS.md`.

The cost: 256 px takes ~12× the wall time of 48 px for the same number of optimizer
steps. Height is both the most valuable knob found so far and by far the most expensive
per epoch — precisely the trade a rung ladder exists to manage.


## 7. Results — height vs. capacity (2026-09-05)

The height axis moves two things at once: `S1(1x0)1,3` folds the residual height into
channels, so h48 gives the LSTM stack 384 inputs and h256 gives it 2048. A pure height
sweep therefore cannot say whether resolution or capacity is doing the work. Arm A varies
the height; Arm B holds it at 128 and buys the same parameter count through LSTM width.
Pairs matched to ~1 % on parameters, measured with kraken's own VGSL builder.

| params | Arm A (height, Lbx200) | Arm B (h128, LSTM width) | Δ | wall A : B |
|---:|---|---|---:|---|
| ~5.7 M | **h256: 0.7515** | Lbx248: 0.7411 | **+0.0104** | 19.9 h : 6.3 h |
| ~4.9 M | **h192: 0.7494** | Lbx224: 0.7346 | **+0.0148** | 11.7 h : 6.3 h |

**Height wins both pairs at matched capacity**, so the gain is not capacity in disguise —
resolution contributes on its own.

**LSTM width, by contrast, is inert.** At fixed height 128: 4.1 M → 0.7355, 4.9 M →
0.7346, 5.7 M → 0.7411. Eight hundred thousand extra parameters buy 0.0009. It is not a
usable axis on this material.

**And height flattens.** 128 → 192 is +0.0139; 192 → 256 is +0.0021 for 70 % more wall
time. The knee is around 192. The intermediate h160 (0.7326) does not sit on a smooth
curve between them, which is the clearest single reminder that these are unreplicated
runs.

*Caveat:* single runs, no seed repetition. Plateau fluctuation in earlier runs was
±0.005–0.01, so the pair differences sit at the edge of that band. Both pairs pointing the
same way while the capacity axis stays flat is what carries the finding; two seeds per
configuration (~52 GPU-hours) would settle it.

**For a production model: height 192, LSTM width 200.** And the ordering of the three
earlier runs is now fully explained — run 3 (h120) beat run 2 and kraken+ (both h64)
because of the height, not the architecture.


## 8. Replication with a second seed (2026-09-07/09) — the §7 finding does not survive

§7 concluded that height beats capacity at matched parameters, from one run per cell.
Repeating four of those cells with `seed 43`, everything else identical:

| configuration | seed 42 | seed 43 | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| h128, Lbx200 *(same config twice — the noise floor)* | 0.7355 | 0.7440 | **+0.0085** |
| h128, Lbx224 | 0.7346 | 0.7352 | +0.0006 |
| h192, Lbx200 | 0.7494 | **0.7272** | −0.0222 |
| h256, Lbx200 | 0.7515 | **0.5591** | **−0.1924** |

*(h128/Lbx248 at seed 43 was still running when the box went unreachable.)*

**The matched pair flips sign.** At seed 42, h192 (0.7494) beat its capacity-matched
partner Lbx224 (0.7346) by 0.0148. At seed 43 the same pair reads h192 0.7272 against
Lbx224 0.7352 — capacity ahead by 0.0080. One seed, opposite conclusion. §7's headline is
withdrawn.

**Run-to-run variance is not one number.** It is a property of the configuration, and it
grows with height:

```
h128/Lbx224   ±0.0006     h192   ±0.0222
h128/Lbx200   ±0.0085     h256   ±0.1924
```

h256 at seed 43 did not merely score lower, it scored 0.5591 — below h64. That is not
noise around a mean; it is a run that trained differently, most likely a partial collapse.
**The tall configurations are unstable**, which is itself a finding: a configuration that
sometimes returns 0.75 and sometimes 0.56 is not a candidate for a production model,
whatever its best run says.

### What survives

* **The coarse effect.** h48 (0.5528) and h64 (0.6475) are worse than everything at 96 and
  above by 0.09 or more — far outside any variance observed here. The two heights S10
  flagged `warn` for leaving under two CTC frames per character are the two worst, and
  that ordering held at both seeds.
* **LSTM width remains inert.** 4.1 M → 4.9 M changed nothing at either seed
  (+0.0009, +0.0006).

### What this means for the method

Rung 0 of the ladder in §1 ranks on a single short run per configuration. On this
material that resolves differences of ~0.09 and cannot resolve ~0.015. Two consequences
for #91:

1. **Promotion must not be decided on differences under ~0.03** at rung 0. Either widen
   the rung to two seeds, or treat the ranking as a filter for the obviously bad rather
   than a ranking of the good.
2. **A collapse is not a low score.** h256's 0.5591 should have been flagged as an
   anomaly, not averaged in. A rung scheduler needs a variance check, not just a maximum.

---

## The order of the sweeps (#118)

Five axes of three values are 243 configurations, which is not a sweep but a
year. What follows is the planned order, so the next sweep does not start over at
the height. Each entry says what would make it worth running *before* the one
above it.

### Sweep 1 — `kraken-medieval-height-augment-lrate-01` (written, not yet run)

`config/sweeps/kraken-medieval-height-augment-lrate-01.yaml`. Height (64/128/192)
× augmentation (off/on) × learning rate (1e-4/3e-4) = 12 cells, ladder 12→4→1,
4,000 optimizer steps at rung 0.

Height is first, against #118's ordering, for a reason that is in the code rather
than in the old results: `KRAKEN_PLUS_SPEC` — the default every kraken run has
used, and the shape behind CER 0.2131 — is height 64, and `vgsl_geometry` puts it
at 1.97 frames per character, just under its own warn threshold of 2.0. The
baseline sits at the bottom of the one direction that held over both seeds of the
first search. h64 is in the sweep as the **control**, not as a candidate.

### Sweep 2 — pre-processing, properly

Whatever sweep 1 says about `--augment` is a binary answer to a question
Ströbel's 1.6-point gap suggests is richer than binary. If augmentation helps,
this sweep asks *which* augmentation, and adds `normalization` (NFD/NFC) and
h96 — the first height above the warn threshold, dropped from sweep 1 only to
keep rung 0 at twelve.

Run it first instead if sweep 1's augmentation effect is the largest thing on its
leaderboard: the axis with a live effect is worth splitting before one without.

### Sweep 3 — fine-tuning against from-scratch

`GET /bases` has ranked kraken bases by script before century since #44. A
fine-tune of a fitting base can beat every architecture variant trained from
scratch — and if it does, the whole search space above is the wrong question.

This is cheap to test and expensive to postpone. **Consider running a two-cell
version of it before sweep 2**: one from-scratch winner of sweep 1 against one
fine-tune of the best-ranked base, same budget. The answer changes what the rest
of the programme is about.

### Sweep 4 — depth, and the batch/learning-rate pair

A fourth convolutional layer or a third LSTM block; neither has been tried
systematically. And the effective batch size, which is tied to the learning rate
by linear scaling and is therefore one axis with it rather than two — 128/256/512
against a rate that moves with it.

Last, because both are refinements of a shape that sweeps 1–3 will have settled
or discarded.

### What does not come back

| | why |
|---|---|
| LSTM width | +0.0009 and +0.0006 over two seeds. Measured, and measured to do nothing. |
| h48 | 1.48 frames/char — below the warn threshold, and ≥0.09 under everything from h96 up at both seeds. |
| h256 | 70 % more compute for +0.0021, and 0.7515 → 0.5591 on a seed change. What sometimes trains to garbage is not a candidate. |
| seed | Varying it measures seed noise. That is #115's job, on one configuration, deliberately. |

### Before any of it

Two things gate every sweep above, and neither is code:

1. **The noise floor** (#115) for this corpus at this budget. Without it a
   leaderboard reports gaps and none of them is known to be one.
2. **Pinned dataset revisions.** None of the four corpora names a `revision`, so
   a sweep's data digest identifies its specs and not the bytes behind them. Two
   sweeps months apart could share a digest and different data.

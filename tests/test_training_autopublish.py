"""When a finished model is uploaded automatically, and when it is not (#88).

Publishing is outward-facing and the hub keeps history, so an unpublish is a
deletion that does not undo the copy someone already pulled. The decision is
therefore separated from the upload, and every refusal states its own reason —
"nothing happened" is the worst possibleanswer for an automatic action.

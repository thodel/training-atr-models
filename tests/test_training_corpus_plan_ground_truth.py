"""The planner must never select a dataset whose card says it is machine output.

Planning 1800-1900 put `handwritten-bundesratsprotokolle_xix-xx` at 45 % of the
corpus with a score of 0.95. Its card reads, verbatim:

    --- Data has been automatically created, using ATR models ---
    These are ''automatically'' transcribed pages.
    !!!This data set does not contain Ground Truth!!!

The scorer read only period, language and script, so a good card for bad data
scored well.

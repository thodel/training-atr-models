"""Surviving a hub rate limit in prepare (#89).

Job 20260822T143612Z-kraken-medieval-german-v2 died in `prepare` on:

    429 Too Many Requests: you have reached your 'api' rate limit.
    Retry after 9 sec

Nine seconds, against a stage that had been running for minutes and would have
run for hours. The limit is easy to reach honestly: verifying a four-dataset
corpus lists every repo and sizes ~1,800 shards before a page is read.

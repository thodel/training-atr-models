"""The backend registry, and the capability it declares on each runner's behalf (#85).

`Backend.supports_chunked_prepare` mirrors a ClassVar on the runner class. The
supervising service cannot read that ClassVar — each runner lives in its own venv
and this service imports neither — so it is declared here and pinned there.

Two sources of truth is a smell, and this file is the price of it. Without the
declaration the size guard read ATR_TRAIN_CHUNK_PAGES alone and cleared a 293 GB
vllm corpus on the strength of a setting the VLM backend ignores.

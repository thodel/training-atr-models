"""The line-geometry guard in the runner (#91, S10).

The guard reads the PageXML ``prepare`` wrote, measures how much width each
character actually gets, and refuses a spec that leaves CTC fewer timesteps than
it needs. These tests drive ``_guard_line_geometry`` directly: the arithmetic has
its own suite in ``test_training_vgsl_geometry.py``, and what matters here is
*when* the runner judges and when it declines to.

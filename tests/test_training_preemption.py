"""Preemption is not cancellation, and a requeued job continues rather than restarts.

A multi-day run on UBELIX's ``job_gpu_preemptable`` QoS is interrupted by design:
the walltime is 24 h and the node can be taken back at any moment. If each of
those interruptions ended the job and the next attempt began at step zero, a
six-day training would never finish. These tests pin the three pieces that make
a requeue transparent — the lifecycle edge, the signal, and the resume path.

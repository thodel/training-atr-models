"""The train/val split does not put a manuscript on both sides (#135).

Measured on `20260915T191232Z-qwen3vl-german-pages-v4`: 416 of its 438 validation
documents were also in its training set — 95 %. The `eval_loss` that the
continuation policy (#88) reads, and every CER against that split, were
in-manuscript numbers.
